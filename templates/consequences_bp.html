                <div class="accordion-content" id="loss-of-trust">
                    <p>A data breach can severely damage an organization's reputation, leading to a loss of trust among customers, partners, and stakeholders. When sensitive information is compromised, individuals may feel vulnerable and hesitant to continue engaging with the organization, fearing further security lapses. This erosion of trust can result in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Financial losses due to customer attrition.</li>
                        <li>Legal consequences as affected parties seek compensation.</li>
                        <li>Business moving to competitors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Moreover, regulatory bodies may impose fines and sanctions, further straining the organization's resources and credibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>GDPR Relevance:</strong> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes strict guidelines for data protection and holds organizations accountable for breaches. Companies must implement robust security measures and promptly notify authorities and affected individuals in the event of a breach. Failure to comply can lead to fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher, exacerbating the financial and reputational damage. GDPR emphasizes the need for proactive security measures to maintain trust.</p>

                    <p>The cost of restoring reputation through public relations efforts, security improvements, and customer compensation can be substantial.</p>
                    <p><strong>GDPR Relevance:</strong> GDPR mandates transparency by requiring prompt disclosure of breaches, which can intensify public backlash if mishandled. Non-compliance can lead to significant fines, further harming credibility. Organizations that fail to comply may be perceived as negligent, worsening reputational harm.</p>
